# Enjoy Tax (Sale summary)

Enjoy tax is an application that made adding up credit card transactions automatically. Figuring out how much was made for each credit card provider (eg. Visa, Master Card, and etc).

# Development reason

I developed this to quickly add and give a summary of the sales that my parents restaurant is made. Before making this application we had to manaully add each transaction from each provider. That took time that I would rather spend elsewhere.

# How it works

<ol>
  <li>The process of getting this to work is going to Square's merchant portal and downloading the monthly sale summary. </li>
  <li>Click and upload file to the application. </li>
  <li>That is it, the prices of each day and total monthly sales are calculated</li>
</ol>
